# Plotting_PM2.5
This repository is for a Coursera Project in Exploratory Data Analysis. It contains R scripts to make plots that can show the change in PM2.5 over a span of years.

Note before the R scripts can be run, the data must be unzipped from the zipped folder. The unzipped folder is included in this repository
